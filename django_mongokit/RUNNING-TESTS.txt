To run the tests you need to have Django in the Python path and you
need to have a settings file and this needs to be export as per example:

        export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=test_settings
	
To be able to run the tests you need to have mongoDB running. Then you
can simply run the tests by running:

        python tests.py
